## An inconsistent system may have r > n. If we try (incorrectly!) to apply Theorem FVCS to such a system, how many free variables would we discover?


An inconsistent system is one where there is no solution. This means that there are  neither one solution, nor many solutions. This is because two of the rows contain identical coefficents 
but different constraints. 

As an example with algebra, one equation may be _x + 2y + z = 0_, and another equation _x + 2y + z = -8_.  Eliminating one either of these with one another will generate a row of the matrix 
where there are still is one nonzero value, but it occupies the constraint column. The corresponding solved  
equation would be something like _0 = -8_, or if each side divided by -8, _0 = 1_. In this case, the value of r would artifically 
be increaesd by 2. Graphically, this means that the equations run parallel to each other. Omitting one equation will provide at 
least one soluton but no one point can satisfy both equations as they do not intersect with each other.

The FVCS theorem is as follows:

### Theorem FVCS Free Variables for Consistent Systems
Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a consistent system of linear equations with  n variables. Suppose also that B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon 
form with r rows that are not completely zeros. Then the solution set can be described with n -ô€€€ r free variables.

In this case, the value r will overcount the number of echelon-reduced rows by the number of inconsistent equations. If r > n, then the formula would result in a negative amount of free variables and it could immediatley be concluded that this was an inconsistent system.
